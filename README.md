## 🔒 Security Considerations

### Important Notes
- This is a **demonstration antivirus** for educational purposes
- **Not a replacement** for professional antivirus software
- **Limited threat database** compared to commercial solutions
- **Use responsibly** and don't rely solely on this tool

### Recommended Usage
- **Educational purposes**: Learn about antivirus concepts
- **Development testing**: Test application security
- **Personal projects**: Basic file analysis needs
- **Complement existing security**: Use alongside professional tools

## 🛠️ Customization

### Modifying Scan Behavior
Edit the `load_virus_signatures()` method to add custom threat patterns:
```python
self.virus_signatures = {
    'custom_threat': 'your_pattern_here',
    'another_threat': 'another_pattern'
}
```

### UI Customization
Modify colors and styling in the `setup_styles()` method:
```python
style.configure('Custom.TLabel', 
               background='#your_color', 
               foreground='#your_text_color')
```

### Adding Features
- **Real-time monitoring**: File system watchers
- **Scheduled scans**: Automated scanning
- **Quarantine system**: Isolate threats
- **Cloud signatures**: Online threat database
